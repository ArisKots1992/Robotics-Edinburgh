# Robotics-Edinburgh
**First** Robot in 2016 (Edinburgh Artificial Inteligence Msc)

*Building a mobile robot from scratch with lego bricks*  
The kinematics of the robot allow it to be omni-directional, using only two IR sensors and one sonar, a collision avoidance algorithm allows the robot move around safely, with a localisation module and an on-line path planning algorithm, the robot can navigate in any maze-like environment successfully.The vision module of the robot is OpenCV based with the ability to identify objects, places and grab certain items


*Developed in 2016*
